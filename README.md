# Propel CRM

A CRM for real estate agents.

... the timing is great ðŸ˜…

## Features

- Production ready Docker configuration
  - Nginx rate limiting, SSL, proxy
- Session based cookie authentication
  - password salt & hashing w/ bcrypt
  - Login in rate limiting via email
- Dashboard overview of recent listings, contacts, tasks, and analytics

- Protected routes on client only shown when valid user data is returned from server

- Listings, Contacts, & Tasks page that show user data in a searchable, filterable & paginated table

  - Contacts searchable by name
  - tasks filterable by priority
  - listings by status (active or sold)

  - each row contains a dropdown menu to perform full CRUD operations on that entity & manage potential relationships w/ other data
    - Add lead (contact) to a listing
    - mark listings as sold to specific lead @ specified price
    - add listing & contact specific tasks

- Analytics page that shows the following for a specified time frame:

  - Sales volume & total sales volume
  - GCI
  - average days to close lead
  - average days on market
  - sale to list ratio

- Authentication & Security (following OWASP standards)

  - XSS validation
  - CSRF protection using the cookie to header pattern
  - Idle / Absolute session management
  - (to implement) authentication in terms of secure password resets, etc

- Shell scripts to automate build processes
  - build/deploy docker images
  - sync client build with s3 and invalidate
  - package docker compose and .ebextensions in zip file for server deployment

## Architecture

### Client

- Tailwind / Shadcn UI (Radix)
  - `./client/src/components/ui` contain shadcn components
  - `./client/src/components` contain my extension of shadcn as well as my own
- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- React Router
- React Query / React Context
- [BulletProof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react) inspired

### Server

- TypeScript
- Node
- Express

### Database

- Redis
- PostgreSQL on [Neon](https://neon.tech/)
- Drizzle ORM

### AWS

- Client on S3 & CloudFront
- Nginx and Express containers on EC2 via Elastic Beanstalk

### Containerization

- Docker

### Proxy Server

- Nginx ( needed to supply own Nginx proxy in docker compose env on beanstalk )

## Getting Started

Populate `./server/.env.example` with your own postgreSQL credentials and:

### Without Docker

`git clone https://github.com/0xcire/Propel-CRM.git propel-crm` \
`cd propel-crm` \
from `propel-crm` ... \
`cd server && npm install && npm run dev` \
`cd client && npm install && npm run dev` \
open up `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser

### With Docker

`git clone https://github.com/0xcire/Propel-CRM.git propel-crm` \
`cd propel-crm` \
`docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` to run in dev mode & \
`docker compose up` to run in prod

### Interacting with DB via Drizzle

Ensure `server/drizzle.config.ts` is properly configured and:

`npm exec drizzle-kit generate:pg` to run migrations \
`npm exec drizzle-kit introspect:pg` to generate schemas based on existing db \
`npm exec drizzle-kit drop` to delete previously generated migrations \
`npm exec drizzle-kit studio` to use Drizzle ORM's new feature to explore your db \
see more commands [here](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/commands)

## Learning Points

- Understanding the full scope of a feature, from db design to ui!

- Getting a better understanding of TypeScript generics

  - useful for data transforming utility functions
  - helped create typesafe, reusable form components based off Shadcn implementation

- Databases

  - Pros/Cons of using SQL vs NoSQL
  - SQL aggregate functions
  - Using Redis to store session data

- Docker

  - Multi stage builds to optimize for production
  - Using docker-compose to sync client, server, and nginx services together

- Nginx

  - Reverse proxy
  - Rate Limiting

<!-- - Back end development concepts -->

- Backend Security Concepts

  - [XSS mitigation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
    - wrote a custom middleware to parse all inputs against a zod schema
  - [CSRF protection](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
    - using cookie to header pattern, and sameSite cookies

- Authentication (extension of above)

  - Differences between JWT and Session/Cookie based auth
  - [effective session mgmt](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html)
    - For my use case, sessions are used for authentication where as JWTs (while not yet implemented) will be used as short lived tokens to do things like reset passwords, and verify emails
  - [Securely handling authentication](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
    - securely handling password hashing
    - note: have yet to address account recovery

## Issues

- React Query and Forms.

  - Ran into issues where default values were not updated after invalidating queries on mutation success.
  - [this TK Dodo article](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-query-and-forms) really helped me out

- Struggled initally with configuring Nginx

- Also had trouble initially wrapping my head around SQL aggregate functions when creating the analytics view

## Notes

- Project is still a WIP. Everything that does not require a third party service and UI enhancements are roughly 90% complete. Excited to then add,

  - Framer Motion animations
  - Verify account email
  - Account recovery email
  - MapBox address autocomplete
  - S3 file upload
  - AWS hosting

- Demo account listings are mostly seeded with data from faker.

  - please see `/server/src/lib/faker.ts` to see how that was done
  - data in analytics and some listing details may not make 100% sense

- Took the time to go through OWASP guides for some security features and while the general recommendation is to use a library where people much more knowledgable than myself can handle all edge cases, I figured this would be a good learning opportunity to understand what is going on

- AWS

  - docs are misleading. if you only intend to use a docker-compose.yml to deploy on elastic beanstalk, you still need to zip that file
  - when using docker compose, provide your own nginx proxy container. default options are ignored.

- Serverless
  - Using some serverless providers in Upstash & Neon, could rearchitect express app/infra to run serverless.
